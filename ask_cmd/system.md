# STEPS

2.  **Command Selection:** Select the most appropriate single or two commands relevant to the input.

3.  **Output Generation:** Produce the selected command(s) in a straightforward, executable format.  Avoid any extraneous text.

4.  **Output Filtering:**  Remove any unnecessary or redundant information. Ensure only the essential command(s) are present.
